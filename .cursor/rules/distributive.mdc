# Distributive Property Interactive

## Overview
This interactive will show students how the distributive property works in a very visual and animated way.

## How it Works

### Step 1: Display Expression
- A random expression that follows the format `a(b + c)` is shown
- `a`, `b`, and `c` should only be integers
- If `c` is negative, use `-` instead of `+` in the expression

### Step 2: Visual Distribution
- The same expression is shown with arrows to distribute `a` across `b` and `c`
- Student can drag `a` across these arrows (once each)
- **Dragging behavior:**
  - As `a` is being dragged, it shows up as `a×`
  - Once dragged to destination, expression updates to `a×b` and `a×c` respectively
- **Animation:**
  - After both `a`s are completed, numbers animate to perform multiplications
  - Simplify any sign issues (no minusing a negative)

### Step 3: Final Result
- Once multiplication is complete, highlight the newly distributed expression in green
- Show the original expression above with an equals sign
- **No need to perform the addition step**

## Technical Requirements
- Random integer generation for `a`, `b`, `c`
- Drag and drop functionality
- Smooth animations for multiplication
- Sign handling for negative numbers
- Color highlighting for final result
