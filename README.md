# distributive_property

## Overview

This interactive will show students how the distributive property works in a very visual and animated way. Students should be able to navigate between steps with `<` and `>` buttons.

## How it Works

### Step 1

A random expression that follows the format `a(b + c)` is shown. `a`, `b`, and `c` should only be natural numbers.

### Step 2

Next arrows will appear to distribute `a` across `b` and `c`. The student is able to drag `a` across these arrows (once each).
As `a` is being dragged, it shows up as `a ×`. Once its dragged to its destination, those parts of the expression will update to `a×b` and `a×c` respectively.
After the second `a` has begun to be moved, the `a` at the beginning of the expression can finally hide.

### Step 3

The numbers will automatically animate to do their respective multiplications.
Once the multiplication is done, it's complete! No need to perform the addition.
