# ➗ Distributive Property Interactive

The distributive property is a fundamental math rule that lets you multiply a number by a group of numbers being added or subtracted. When you see an expression like **4(10 + 8)**, you can "distribute" the 4 to both numbers inside the parentheses: **4×10 + 4×8**. This gives you the same result as doing the addition first, but it's often easier to calculate mentally.

This interactive teaches the distributive property through four engaging steps: (1) **See the Expression** - view a randomly generated problem like 4(10 + 8), (2) **Drag to Distribute** - physically drag the outside number to both terms inside the parentheses, (3) **Watch Multiplication** - see the multiplications solve themselves with smooth animations, and (4) **Final Addition** - watch the final addition step complete with a highlighted result. Perfect for visual learners who need to see math concepts in action!
