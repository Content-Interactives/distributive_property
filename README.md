## 📚 Standards & Subjects

This interactive aligns with the following topics and standards:

- **📂 Subject Area**: Middle School Math (Grade 6)  
- **🧮 Topic**: Distributive Property — Applying the Distributive Property of Multiplication  
- **📏 Common Core**:  
  - **CCSS.Math.Content.6.NS.B.4** – Use the distributive property to express a sum of two whole numbers 1–100 with a common factor as a multiple of a sum of two whole numbers with no common factor. For example, express 36 + 8 as 4(9 + 2).  
  - **CCSS.Math.Content.6.EE.A.3** – Apply the properties of operations to generate equivalent expressions. For example, apply the distributive property to the expression 3(2 + x) to produce the equivalent expression 6 + 3x; apply the distributive property to the expression 24x + 18y to produce the equivalent expression 6(4x + 3y); apply properties of operations to y + y + y to produce the equivalent expression 3y.  
  - **CCSS.Math.Content.6.EE.A.4** – Identify when two expressions are equivalent (i.e., when the two expressions name the same number regardless of which value is substituted into them). For example, recognize that 3(2 + x) and 6 + 3x are equivalent expressions.
