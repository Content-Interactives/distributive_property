# 🎓 Educational Interactive Template - Cursor Rules

## 🚨 PRIMARY RULE: Interns Must Only Edit Within Green Boundaries

This template has strict boundaries where non-technical interns can safely edit code.
**NEVER suggest edits outside the marked green sections in App.jsx.**


## 🔒 PROTECTED FILES - DO NOT TOUCH

**NEVER modify any files in the `/src/template/` folder or its subfolders.**
This includes: Template.jsx, Flexi.js, Footer/, Header/, assets/, index.js
**ONLY App.jsx has safe editing zones marked with green comments.**

## ✅ SAFE EDITING ZONES - Green Boundary Comments

**ONLY edit code between these exact comment markers in App.jsx:
`{/* 🟢 HEY CURSUR! VIBE CODE INSIDE THIS AREA BELOW! */}`
and 
`{/* 🟢 HEY CURSUR! VIBE CODE INSIDE THIS AREA ABOVE! */}`**

## 🛠️ TOOLS TO USE

**ALWAYS use Tailwind CSS classes, never custom CSS.**
**ALWAYS request screenshots when users report errors.**
**ALWAYS use React libraries instead of manual implementations.**
**NEVER delete comments in App.jsx outside the green editing zones.**

## 👨‍💼 USER GUIDANCE

**ALWAYS guide users with small, incremental steps for large requests.**
**Act as a senior React engineer - break complex tasks into simple parts.**
